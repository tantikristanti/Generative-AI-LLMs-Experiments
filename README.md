# Generative-AI-LLMs-Experiments

Generative AI encompasses computational techniques designed to generate original content such as text, images, or audio, derived from training data. The advent of technologies like Deepseek, MetaAI, and Mistral AI is reshaping professional and communicative practices globally. These systems are not only tools for creative endeavours, such as authorship replication or illustrative recreation, but also valuable assistants in practical tasks, including question-and-answer functions.

This repository contains experiments of implementing different models, libraries, and applications within Large Language Models (LLM) based generative AI (Gen AI) to identify optimal technologies across diverse domains and scenarios. Each subdirectory provides detailed insights into specific systems, encompassing their operational workflows, libraries, source code, and experimental results.
